\section{Immediate Objective}
We would like to use the MUSE IFU data to measure the metallicity in the host galaxy using the [N II] and H $\alpha$ lines in the regions around the SNe. We would like to compare the metallicities in the sites for SN2012Z, a faint, peculiar Iax SNe to the measurement for a normal SNIa 2002fk in the same galaxy. Since both SNe have detailed photometric and spectroscopic datasets, we would like to relate the properties of the SN to the host metallicity.
