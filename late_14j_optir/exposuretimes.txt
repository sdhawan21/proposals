For the IR, these are pure, on source exposure times. After talking to stephan, a good estimate of total IR exposure time + overheads is greater by a factor of ~ 3. For the optical it would be ~ 30 %

Total exposure time for dark nights: 336 s

For dark + 2.0 mag: 900 s

Total number of epochs to be sampled:
~8-10
