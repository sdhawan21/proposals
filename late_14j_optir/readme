Proposal on the 2m HCT in IAO, Hanle

Aim: To obtain v. late time optical and Infrared light curves of SN2014J in M82

Purpose: 
1. from the pseudo-bolometric light curve, determine the positron trapping in the supernova and hence also the nature of the weak magnetic field

2. To determine the epoch at which the supernova transitions in the IR from the 'plateau' phase (eg. 2001el; Stritzinger & sollerman 2007) to a further decline after ~700 days
